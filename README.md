[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tiffany-brand/professional-README-generator?style=plastic)](./LICENSE)


## Description

This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. When the application runs, it presents a series of prompts in the command line to the user to fill in different sections in the README. Once the user is done answering all the questions, the final readme is generated and stored in the output folder.
